# Worldswitch
The worldswitch is a project about creating a VPN device available to the users of our local hackerspace, hal9k.dk.

Getting on the internet in another part of the world is intuitive and easy; There are 48 locations available, select a destination by plugging an ethernet cable into the desired port on the device.

No configuration is neededâ€”no need to worry about leaking outside the tunnels.

We added an access point that can be plugged into a destination for mobile devices and other wifi-things.

## Contents
[ansible/](ansible/) for setting up the routing device - we are using a raspberry pi, but anything should do - it depends heavily on systemd but should be otherwise distro independent.

[groupvar/](groupvar/) some go code reading [ansible/group_vars/all.yml](ansible/group_vars/all.yml) and generates an updated one based on Mullvad's HTTP API.

[linkchange/](linkchange/) a go daemon running on the access point for detecting link changes and updating SSIDs accordingly.

[j4899a.config](j4899a.config) our particular switch's configuration; We Needed to configure VLANs for every port available on the switch.

## Build your own
We are going to assume the reader is capable of identifying qualified old networking gear from their scrap bin:
* Some VLAN-capable switch
* Some Linux box
* Optionally an OpenWRT access point

Everything else should be included:
* Configure the switch
* Update secrets in [ansible/router.yml](ansible/router.yml)
* Run the [groupvar/](groupvar/) code for updating VPN endpoints
* Run the ansible playbook against the Linux box
* Optionally configure the access point and add the [linkchange/](linkchange/) daemon
* cyber!
